patched: use the localhost correctly!
========

``patched`` is a mini-framework for patching with emphasis on simplicity, relative safety and human-oriented interface.
In regard of patching,
what it allows is basically to replace any callable with a user-defined one.

Hopefully that features make it useful not only for patching, but also logging, debugging, testing.

It aims to make equally easy to write a couple of throw-away patches and to store modules with debug patches
(or mocks for local development) that others can use without looking at their code.
