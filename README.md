patched: use the localhost correctly!
========

``patched`` is a mini-framework for patching with emphasis on simplicity, relative safety and human-oriented interface.
In regard of patching,
what it allows is basically to replace any callable with a user-defined one.

Hopefully that features make it useful not only for patching, but also logging, debugging, testing.

It aims to make equally easy to write a couple of throw-away patches or to store modules of debug patches
(or mocks for local development) that others can use without looking at their code.

The package size is 600 SLOC so don't fear to look in the code!
